My name is Willie Cheeks (@WillieJJR) and I'm currently a Data Scientist with about 3 Years of experience in Government Technology Consulting. I currently hold a Master's in Analytics.

My primary interests/experiences are in:
- Uncovering insights by leveraging a combination of Analytics, Machine Learning and Statistics
- Building Data Science products using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) tools or Open Source Programming (Python, R) 
- Using data to positively influence change around the world


I hope to use this Github Repository to continue tracking my progress and to positively contribute to the abundance of open source code!
